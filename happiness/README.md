The dataset comprises a total of 2,363 entries with the following columns:

- **Country name**: The name of the nation.
- **Year**: The year in which the data was collected.
- **Life Ladder**: A measure of subjective well-being.
- **Log GDP per capita**: The logarithm of GDP per capita, indicating economic performance.
- **Social support**: A metric for social connections and support systems within a society.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: The average number of years a newborn is expected to live in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: A measure of the freedom individuals feel they have regarding choices that shape their lives.
- **Generosity**: A measure reflecting individuals' charitable contributions.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: The perceived level of corruption within a country’s institutions.
- **Positive affect**: The incidence of positive emotions in people's daily lives.
- **Negative affect**: The incidence of negative emotions.

### 2.1 Missing Values

The analysis identified missing values in 8 columns, though the specific columns with missing data are not explicitly mentioned. Strategies to handle these missing values could involve imputation, omission, or using advanced methods like multiple imputation.

## 3. Summary Statistics

### Key Metrics:
- The dataset contains entries from a range of years, with a mean year of approximately **2014.76** and a span from **2005** to **2023**.
- **Life Ladder** scores range from **1.281** (indicative of low well-being) to **8.019** (indicative of high well-being), with a mean score of approximately **5.484**.
- **Log GDP per capita** varies widely, from **5.527** to **11.676**, reflecting significant economic disparities across countries.
- Other metrics such as Social support (mean = **0.809**), Healthy life expectancy (mean = **63.40** years), and Freedom to make life choices (mean = **0.750**) also demonstrate variability that warrants deeper analysis.

The following table summarizes these statistics:

## 4. Data Insights

### 4.1 Skewness and Distribution
Upon analyzing the distributions of numeric columns, we observed potential skewness, indicating that some columns may not follow a normal distribution. 

### 4.2 Detection of Outliers
Outliers were detected, particularly in columns such as **Life Ladder** and **Log GDP per capita**. These outliers may impact the analysis, warranting further exploration to determine whether they represent errors or genuinely extreme values.

### 4.3 Correlation Analysis
Based on the correlation heatmap generated:
- **Life Ladder** shows a strong positive correlation with **Log GDP per capita** (0.756), suggesting a relationship between a nation’s wealth and its citizens' well-being.
- A moderate correlation exists between **Social support** and **Life Ladder** (0.463), indicating that social networks may play a significant role in life satisfaction.
